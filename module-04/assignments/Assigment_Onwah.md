# Assignment 4

- I used the H1 tag, and inline CSS style to make `Catalog` bigger and center it, since it is the main Title.
- I used the HTML `<ul>` list, and `<article>` tag to display all the items
- I used `<h3>` to display the Product ID, and also `<p>` to dispay the product description as a paragraph.
- I also rendered the table as directed, and then used  `if test` to check and dispay `Men` as `M` and `Women` as `W`
    and then created a table of two colums insided each of the small, medium and large colums.
