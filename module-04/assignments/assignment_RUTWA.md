# Thought Process:-
->This is the divided into two parts displaying data in list and table.
->List is quiet easy with help odf xsl:for-each and selecting elemnent to be display.
->XPATH is combination of / and element names also '@' for attributes.
->For-each is loop is used to display n number of elements
->'value-of' is for the value to be selected from the element.
->It was a task to create subtables, I personally faced issue with finding the current node. But with help of '.' the subtables display current nodes.
->Other than that xsl is very easy to write as it follows xml structure. 
->xsl:if lets us render the data as user defined format. Like in this example M for Men and W for Women.
->xsl:if is a condition to play around with displaying data as per conditions.
