## Thougth Process:
-> Here in this assignment, first i tried to visual the output and started creating tags and making html element display the all details
->After that,implementing the templates with conditions and while doing this I came to know about new things like "For each" and "IF" in xsl file.
->At last, I think this type of questions require lots of hands on practice.
