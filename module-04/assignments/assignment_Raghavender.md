-- For the main title "Catalog" I have used h1 tag. 
-- To display the products in the catalog I have used <ul> list.
-- As instructed I have used <article> tag inside the <li> tag. The <article>  tag makes the content independent from the other content.
-- Used <h3> tag for product id and <p> for description.
