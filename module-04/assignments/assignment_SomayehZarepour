At first XSL template should match with root element (/). Then we start writing the HTML code for rendering catalog element from XML file. By using for-each loop we can select all children tag of catalog. Tag. and we put product-id and description attributes of product tag in <h3> and <p> tag.
Then we start designing table and wrapped selected columns in <tr>tag. Second for-each is used for accessing the value of each element. By if condition we declare if attributeâ€™s value of gender is Men or Women. And again, we use if condition for declaration different sizes. We designed a sub table for each size by declaration color and image columns. We do this for all four sizes.
