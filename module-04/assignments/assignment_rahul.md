First, I created the assignment.xsl file in the assignments directory.
Then I linked this file to the xml file. 
Then I wrote the title for this file and after this 
in the list tag I render all the items.
I displayed product id  as heading with h3 and with blue color.
Furthermore, I displayed all the column in table format with given conditions.
