Learning Curve: It was a great experience while creating this document. Although most of the elements and tags used were discussed in class, but it was exciting to use text(), and other xpath epressions. As I am relatively new to XSLT technology, I learnt more about syntax and structure of XSLT templates and use of various XSLT elements, such as xsl:for-each, xsl:value-of, and xsl:if.
