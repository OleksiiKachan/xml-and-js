4. Thought process

- In this I understood what <!-- <xsl:for-each> --> and <!-- <xsl:value-of> --> perfoms and based on that I created this xsl file. Also I learned where I use <!-- <xsl:choose> -->, <!-- <xsl:when> --> & <!-- <xsl:if --> these all tags.

Create `module-4/assignments/assignment_YOURNAME.md` and explain your thought process in it. Add screenshots of each step to the file (Refer `week-1/assignments/evaluation-1.md` on how to add image to md file)
