    - render each item as `<article>` inside list item tag

    - display product id as h3
    - display product description as paragraph

    - render table of catalog items with columns: item number, price, gender, small, medium, large, extra large (if column item is not present in item, then display empty cell)
    - for gender column render M for Men, W for Women

    - inside size columns (small, medium, large, and extra large) display subtable with 2 columns: color and image

5. Thought process:

-   Here we have used tag <xsl:for-each> which used to render data while it is in list form. <xsl:if> is used to categorised the small, medium, large category. also we used some html tags like <h3> <ui> <ul>.
