# Assignment

In creating the XSL file, the first thing I did was that I made sure the template (matching the root "/") is used to create the structure of the HTML document including the head and body elements.

Inside the body, I created an H1 element for "Catalog", followed by an unordered list (ul) that is generated by applying templates to the "catalog/product" elements in the XML document.

The second template (matching "product") was used to create an article element for each "product" element in the XML document. Within the article element, an h3 element is used to display the value of the "product_id" attribute, a paragraph (p element) displays the value of the "description" attribute, and a table element that displays information about each "catalog_item".

I also used the third template (matching "catalog_item") to create a table row (tr) for each "catalog_item" element in the XML document. The row includes cells that display the item number, price of the product and gender.  The last three cells display information about the available sizes (small, medium, large, extra large) and color swatches for each size.

Finally, the XSL file uses the "xsl:apply-templates" and "xsl:value-of" elements to extract data from the XML document and present it in the HTML document. It should be noted that the "xsl:if" element is used to conditionally include elements based on the values of certain attributes. 
The "xsl:choose" element is used to choose between different elements based on the values of certain attributes.
