I have worked on Javascript, CSS part.
I have done the nearest city on the JS.
I connected to the API for the airline project using the below link
http://api.airvisual.com/v2/nearest_city?key=${key}
Then I get the json code from the above javascript file and stored the results.
Then I generated the data to the HTML file to display the results.
In CSS, I have created one css file and added the background image to the file.
Added styles to each part of the html page to look better.

Output:
