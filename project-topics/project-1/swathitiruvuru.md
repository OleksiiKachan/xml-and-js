I worked on  html and js document creation and also xsl.

html - linked xml to html using xhttp verified the status of request.
       parsed to each element in the xml and linked to html tags to make it on the web page.
       used js and also css for styling.

xsl - linked xml with xsl and defined the required table headers and parsed the xml data to display accordingly in the table format.
      I have looped through each details of book and parsed the data to display in the table.
      Each book has multiple catalogs and applied for each loop to parse multiple catalogs and display the table inside a table.
