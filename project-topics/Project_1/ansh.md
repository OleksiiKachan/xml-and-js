The root element of the XML document is "automotives", which can contain multiple "automotive-maker" elements. 
Each "automotive-maker" element represents a car manufacturer and includes information  manufacturer's ID, name, address, and the models of cars they produce.

The "carModels" element within each "automotive-maker" element contains a list of "ModelDetails" elements, each of which represents a specific car model and includes information such as the model's ID, name, year, and price in different currencies.

The "cars" element within each "automotive-maker" element contains a list of "car" elements, each of which represents a specific car and includes information such as the car's VIN, color, and buyer.

Overall, this schema provides a standard structure for representing automotive-related data in an XML format, which can be useful for exchanging data between different systems or applications.
