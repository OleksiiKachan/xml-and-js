Me and Garry worked together on a project in the college that involved using stock market details and data from the Coinlayer API, as well as implementing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.The code is using jQuery to make an API call to Coinlayer to get the current price of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP. It is using an access key to authenticate the request and appending a target currency to the API endpoint URL based on which radio button is selected. The fetched data is then parsed as JSON and used to update the text of corresponding HTML elements. The code is triggered by a click event on the radio buttons.
