Thought process is that the document must 
-The start tag and the end tag must be the same, also nesting of elements must be proper.
-The document can only have one root element.
-Two attribute value must not have the same name in an element.

A valid XML document is when the document is well-formed and also meets the rules of DTD which are;
-The root element in the document must be the same root element declared in DTD.
-An XML document cannot have arbitrary tags.
-All tags in an XML document must be declared in DTD has to be used in the way itâ€™s declared in DTD.

While validation website only performs syntax check if neither an XML schema nor a DTD is declared, and DTD has not been declared in the Product.XML document.
