Here is the output of my xsl file and that is ![image info](../assets/assignment_1.png)

Here is the snapshot of linking the xsl file to xml ![image info](../assets/link.png)

Here, in this file, I have used the embedded css style.
I have used table tag to make a table and I styled it by changing the font colour and aligning the text to the centre.
Then, for unordered list ul tag is used here.
choose tag is used to select the gender whether it is male or female.
for-each tag is used when we used that tag in xml file for multiple times.
td and tr are used for table data and table rows.
