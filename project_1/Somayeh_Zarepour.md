In this project, I was responsible for converting json file to xml.
The whole work was just a sequence of parent and child elements. At first, I created a root element named `stockmarket`, which contains the `market` elements. I defined `id` as an attribute for the market element, and defined `name`, `currency`, `address`, `stocks` and `accounts` as child elements for the market element.
The element address itself includes the child elements `street`, `city`, `region` and `country`.
Then i defined `stocks` element which is included 4 child elements named `stock`, then I defined `symbol` as attribute for stock element and other elements such as `name`, `sector` , `industry`, `marketcap` and `price` as a child element for stock element.
I repeated these steps for all four stock element. After that , I defined `accounts` element, which includes two child elements named `account`. For account elements, I defined two child elements named `holder` and `bank`. The holder element itself includes child elements such as `firstname`, `lastname`, `gender`, `occupation`, and the bank element includes `iban` element. Finally, since we have 14 markets, I repeated all of the steps for the others.
