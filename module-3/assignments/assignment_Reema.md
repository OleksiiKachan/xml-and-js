4. Both XSD and DTD are markup language, but they are different at some attributes.
As fas as I understand, XSD is easier to learn than DTD. I mean to say, we do not need to learn new language to understand the xsd because it is too simple to understand.
DTD does not allow us to write datatypes as well as namespace. On the other hand, XSD allow us to write these.
I think XSD is an improved version of DTD.



For the XSD file, I added the assignment.xsd file
and for the DTD, I modified the file assignment.xml to add the DTD
