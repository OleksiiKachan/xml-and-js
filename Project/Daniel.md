Created xml file for university.json
I formated the json file and created a xml schema file. I checked if the document is well validated using xml Validate XML files (xmlvalidation.com) 


The stylesheet element needs to be placed in the http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform namespace.

Structure of stylesheet of XSLT:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
Style Sheet Contents
</xsl:stylesheet>

created a html file to load all data from xml to html 

During the lecture, we started by dividing roles together then we divided the work that Edwina is Doing DTD and XSD and Daniel is doing XML xsl and html  and we worked together using Teams to adquatly complete the assignmenmt.
