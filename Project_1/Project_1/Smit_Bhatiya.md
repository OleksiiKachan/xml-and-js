-> In this library project, we worked as a team and devide all the work to the group member seprately.
-> In this project, I worked on xml file and html file.
-> Firstly, I created xsd file with define all the data types of element and make a data in structure way.
-> After that, I worked on html file where I used xml file to show all the data on server and used GET method. In this html file, I added little bit CSS with the help of width.
-> There are two foremost elements which are Library and Catalog. So that, I decided to create two separate tables of these raw data and provide sub-information of those data into the table.
-> With the use of basic table tag like th and td, I created column for these data. The first table I created which include following data: ID, Name, Specialty and Address.
-> I made function as "displayCatelog" to retreive a data of book from xml file and store in array and made "displaylibrary" function to display all the data with the form of table and apply javaScript.
