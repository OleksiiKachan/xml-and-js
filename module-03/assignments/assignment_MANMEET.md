4. Explain your thought process for these 2 declarations

Create `module-3/assignments/assignment_YOURNAME.md` and add your theory answers. Add screenshots of each step to the file.

Here, in this assignment, I have worked on both the declarations. The syntax of both is different.
For DTD, we have to remember the opening DOCTYPE with the brackets and the modifying symbols.
Whereas for xsd, the syntax is pretty much related to what we are doing. It's easy to remember.

I feel attribute defining is more simpler in DTD as compared to xsd specially when we have to do the extension.

For me, both the declarations are fine as of now.
