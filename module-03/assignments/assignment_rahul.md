I found DTD more easy as compared to XSD, because in this i don't need to focus on the openning and closing tag of root, child elements.
but i XSD we need to take care of the complexType, elements, sequence and their closing tags too.
XSD require more time and focus as compared to DTD, howerver XSD is easy to understand comparatively DTD.
