2. Create DTD for this file and validate it using any of the tools we used
    ![dtdvalidatrion](../assets/dtd.png)

3. Create XSD for this file and validate it using any of the tools we used
    ![xsdvalidation](../assets/dtd.png)


4. Explain your thought process for these 2 declarations.

    also xsd is written similar to the xml file and more readable as it is well indented.
