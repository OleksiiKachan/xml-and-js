4. Explain your thought process for these 2 declarations


-In the first declaration DTD, the piece of code gives an idea about overall logic of sequence but on the other hand it doesn't specify how many number of elements are present inside the parent node as well as a specific elements are present or not is neither.
-Also, while structuring DTD for a particular XML, the datatype of the attributes as well as elements are unknown.

-In the second declaration XSD, the piece of code clarifies the datatype pf attributes as well the elements.
-With the help of namespaces it becomes easier to understand as well as write the code for the following xml.

-Moreover, with the use of XSD more exposure can be given on elements along with the attributes and certain additional data can also be specified while the same is not the case with DTD as it only helps in giving the basic information on elements and attributes.
