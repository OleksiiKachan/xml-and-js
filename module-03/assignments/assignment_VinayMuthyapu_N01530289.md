    DTD - While defining Document type definition we have to go through each element and define each element of the xml with valid DTD tag.
          we have to follow the specified format to define dtd.

    XSD - XML Schema Definition is simple way to define the xml document which is understandable and can be created easyly which just looks like xml with definition to the actual xml file.
