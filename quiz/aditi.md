I created a CSS code that tells a web page how to look. It starts with setting the page's margins and background colour. 

The unordered list (ul) is made to have a 1-pixel border and no bullet points. Setting padding to 0 will get rid of any empty space inside the list.
Next, the h1 tag, which probably has the page's main title, is made to be centered, have a font size of 45 pixels, and a font weight of 600, which means it's pretty bold.
The ID "results" is then used to style the element with flexbox. This makes the element's parts flexible, so they can be put in rows or columns. The "flex-flow" feature is set to "row wrap," which means that the items will be put in rows and, if necessary, wrap to the next row.

Each card element, which probably has a piece of information, is given a width of 25% minus 4 pixels, which takes into account any edges. The direction is set to column and the display is set to flex. This means that the element's information will be arranged vertically. To make the sides of the element round, the border is set to 1 pixels and the radius is set to 25 pixels. Black is the colour of the background, and white is the colour of the words. The bottom height is set to 20 pixels to give the card some space from the part below it.

The h2 tag, which is usually used for a section, is made to be a certain colour.
The h4 tag, which is probably used for a smaller heading or description, is made to use a certain font family and have a 5-pixel margin at the bottom. The bottom padding is set to 0 to get rid of any extra room.
Lastly, the p tag, which is used for normal text, has no border or padding at the top to get rid of any extra space.
