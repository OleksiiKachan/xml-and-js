-- Topic- Software Company logo Search

-- We both first created account on clearbit to get the token.
-- We tried various api's to load  and search the appropriate data.
-- Then we decided to use autocomplete API to search the data.
-- We fetched the api and then map the data to print the data.
-- The search operation is performed using name to display name, logo and domain of the company.
-- Add some css to display it properly.
-- We both equally contributed for the project.
