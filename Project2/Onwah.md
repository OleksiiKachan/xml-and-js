# Project 1


1) I created the javascript to show details about crypto wioth the follwoing fields: name, icon, symbol, max_supply:  
- Registered and got Access Key 
- fetch data from the API using Async function
- create a display data fuction, that accepts data from the fechdata function,loop through the objects, and pass the elements into a ratewrapper variable. .
- also created a search function that accepts the symbol name as an arguement and searches for that symbol.
- in the search function, I also used the `toLowercase` method to ensure that case sensitivities do not affect the serach results.
