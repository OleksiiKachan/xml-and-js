Contribution to the project (Topic: bank - API -Currency conveter):

I'm responsible for creating html and css code.

HTML code:
This code is creating a basic currency converter web page with a form that allows users to input an amount, select the currency they want to convert from, select the currency they want to convert to, and calculate the converted amount.

The HTML code defines the structure of the web page, including the page title, a link to an external stylesheet (bank.css), a header, a form with various elements such as input fields and select boxes, and a placeholder for displaying the current exchange rate.

The JavaScript file (bank.js) is responsible for fetching the current exchange rate from an external API and updating the exchange rate display. It also handles the conversion calculation when the user clicks the "Calculate" button.

CSS code:
This code is defining the styling for a currency converter web page.

The CSS code is targeting various elements on the page such as the body, container, header, form, input fields, and buttons, and defining their appearance and layout properties.

For example, it sets the background color of the body to lightseagreen, defines the width and maximum width of the container, sets the font size and margin of the header, styles the input fields and select boxes with border radius and background color, and sets the background color and font properties of the button.
