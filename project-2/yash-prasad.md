# My Contribution for the Project-2:

Hello Sir, I am Yash Prasad. On our project 1 topic which was Software Company, we got a 3rd party API.
It was regarding the logo search "https://dashboard.clearbit.com/docs#logo-api". 
I worked on the JavaScript functions that fetches data from a JSON file and display corresponding logos based on user input.
Created a collections.json to store information about different company names and their corresponding domain names.
Also added a functionality of "Search outside collection" which allow us to search for logos of websites that are not included in the predefined collection.json. When we enter a website name that is not found in the JSON file, the JavaScript code constructs a URL to fetch the logo from Clearbit's API and displays it on the page.
Also implemented event handlers to handle form submissions and reload the page.
