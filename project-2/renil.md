- First of all, I've created acoount in krogers api page to get client id and client secret code.
- Furthermore, I've tried and tested that id and secret key in out project but unfortunately I got some errors for genereting token to fetch product data.
- So, I tried Postman to test the api and generate token and that works perfectly fine for me. So with the help of that hard coded token I've tried this project.
- I've created a onsubmit form in html through which when user enter product name it will show particular product category in listing.
