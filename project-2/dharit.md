## Team Contribution to the project

In this project, I worked on the two api, the first one will get you all the countries and the second one will get you all the states but first you have to pass the countries in this api. The countries which I'm getting is in the object format, so first I convert it into the array and the populate that array onto a dropdown so it will be easy for user to choose the country. Also, I have add a onChange listner on the dropdown which will take the selected option as input and  triggered will another api which will get all the states acaording to the countries Which will also get populated on the dropdown.
