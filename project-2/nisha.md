- In this project I have created base for the html and css
- For the java script part , where I've got the API response for getMakes and getModels Functions then display it in the browser using HTML and CSS
- Using below 2 API's :
1.  const url = "https://www.carboninterface.com/api/v1/vehicle_makes";
## this one gets the info about makes

2. const url = `https://www.carboninterface.com/api/v1/vehicle_makes/${makeId}/vehicle_models`;
## thia one gets the onfo about models

- Also, I have created one function to populate dropdown for make, when its selected.
