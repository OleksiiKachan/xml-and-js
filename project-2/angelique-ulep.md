I initially created the html and js draft file that would be the base file for Ricardo and Amos.
They both improved the said filed by adding styling (CSS) and adding functions for the game to work.
I created the js function that would fetch data from the ClearBit logo API.
After Amos did the styling and Ricardo did the guess text area, I tested our whole application.
I modified the project to handle scenarios when there is null nextSlide.
I also modified the logic for checking user answers.
