==> I worked HTML and two functions called "dogImage()" and "dogDetails()" to display the fatched data to display the images and relative information of the fatched object.

==> The dogImage function takes an argument called imageUrl and sets the source attribute of an HTML element with an ID of dog-image to the value of imageUrl

==> The dogDetails function takes an array called breeds as an argument and extracts some properties from it such as breed name, origin, temperament, life span, bred for, breed group, height and weight. It then creates an HTML string that contains this information and sets it as the innerHTML of an HTML element with a class of dog-info.
