# Project 2

- Read API documentation to understand how to use the API
    - API used: `https://docs.carboninterface.com/#/`
    - Learned how to use Postman
    - Used Postman to understand how to use the API to fetch JSON data
     
- API used to fetch the data
    - Converted the mentioned CURL commands into usable fetch commands to use in JS
    - Implemented the fetching in the way taught in class where we fetch all the data once and store it in one `_data` variable and use that throughout the application without the need to fetch again.
