- I generated the API keys from the given links. Then as per the documentation tried to access the data from the api into the JavaScript file. I mainly worked on JS and got inputs from my team mebers as well.
- Once the data was accessible in JS file, I found out a way to render the data and include it into the HTML, for that made the methods using async await like getCountryData, getCitiesUsingIP etc. and if the data was fethced successfully then only it was loaded otherwise log the error.
