# My Contribution

After the completion of xml and dtd file from Abhay, I was given the responsibility to do xslt and html file.

XSLT:
-Once the xml and dtd was completed I first observed the xml and than created xslt file for the construction project.
-Inside the xslt file I have formatted the data in the tabular format.
-Data has been parsed using xslt tags by referring to the xml file and displayed on the screen.
-The labours slot, workers data and address has been presented in detail in the table by linking both the files with each other.
-Limited style has been added to the file as well.

HTML JS:
-Next step after the completion of xslt file from my side and xsd file from a team member Gurpreet and than started working on the html js for construction project.
-For html we first linked the html file with css and than stored the root element data inside the variable.
-Element information has been parsed using the js along side html.
-At the end the data has been formatted in the list format where the labours slot, workers data, in-detail address, equipment quantity and type, supply quantity and type has been presented as well.
