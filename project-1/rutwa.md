I created xml file, xsd and xslt
Firstly I converted airlines.json to xml so that based on that every other file can be created.
-XML has root element airlines and elements airline have different sub elements.
-XSD has mostly complextype elements and I have handled it with min and max bounds for most elements
-XSLT, for this I have used table and subtables and list  
    -Table for each airlines/airline
    -List has park element
    -subtable for root
    -We display elements using for-each and Xpath is given for that element.
