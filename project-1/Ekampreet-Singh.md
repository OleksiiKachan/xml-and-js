The first task to complete any group project is to divide the tasks which the team members are going to do and thus we divided it by me taking the DTD and HTML generation and my team mate Vasyl taking the remianing part of generating XML, XSD and XSLT files. 

Being a good team player, Vasyl sent me the XML file on a timely manner, which he generated from "automitive.json" and named it as "automotive.xml"

After receiving that file, I produced the DTD in the prolog of the same xml file. I also validated it by going to the online resource "https://www.xmlvalidation.com/" and included the screenshot of the output at location: "project-1/assets/xml_dtd_validation.png". 

The second task for me was to generate the HTML file and use the XML file to dynamically populate it. Then I made it a bit more presentable by using CSS. A snapshot of the generated HTML file in a browser is placed at: "project-1/assets/dynamicHTMLGeneratedOutput.png".

Thanking you,
