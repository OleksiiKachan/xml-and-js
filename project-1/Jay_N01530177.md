# Project Explanation in brief

- We have a zoo and zoo json file here in this project. JSON files have a large number of data objects and object arrays. As a result, in this project, we must first analyse the json file before designing an xml file and DTD. Even though the json file is very large and creating xml is difficult, we make every effort to design the file. Then, to dynamically load data from your xml into html, construct an XSLT and html file along with javascript code. In order to present data in the correct format, the main objective of this project is to produce an xml file from a json file.
