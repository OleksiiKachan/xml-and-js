- 1. I was responsible for designing and creating the base xml file
To accomplish this task, I first understood the structure and content of json file, understood the key value pairs, arrays and objects to determine how to translate that data into an XML format. After designing the XML structure, I created the actual xml file (automotive.xml).

- 2. I was also responsible for creating an HTML page and dynamically loading data from an XML file, I firstly tried getting clear understanding of the XML data. I then designed the HTML structure and layout, identifying the areas where I wanted to load data from the XML file. To load data dynamically from the XML file into the HTML page, I wrote JavaScript code that read the XML data, extracted the necessary information, and populated the HTML page with that data.
