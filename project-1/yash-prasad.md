# My Contribution for the Project-1:

Hello Sir, I am Yash Prasad.
I've worked on the HTML & JS part for the projrct, alongside helping my teammate in xsl file.

In the HTML code, I have linked the website to the CSS file named "sft.css" to style the website. The body of the website contains a header with the title "Software Companies". Also used an ordered list with the ID "software", which is also the root tag of our xml file.

To read data from the "sft.xml" XML file, JavaScript uses an XMLHttpRequest. When the answer is prepared with a status of 200, the function displayData is called. A string can be used to build an HTML element using the function stringToNode.

Three functions are created to display the data from the XML file. createApps creates a table that lists the applications of a company. createCompany creates a list item with information about a company. createEmployees creates a table that lists the employees of a company.
