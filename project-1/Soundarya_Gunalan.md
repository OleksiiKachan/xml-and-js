## Creating XSL from XML:
I created XSL from XML. The xml has 15 zoos and details of many more animals and employees in every zoo.
I have used for each loop to load each zoo dynamically.
I have loaded the zoos as list
The data under animals and employees also need to beloaded .
So I have also used for each loop to load the data.
I have represented Animals and Employees data in table.



## Creating XSD from XML:

XSD is the schema of the xml.
The XMl is a complex type because of its complex structure.
I have explored the xml and cvfreated the tags respectively.
Where element tags represent the tag name and its data type.
The zoo element and its attributes are defined first.
The Animal element and its atributes are defined then the Employee elements and its attribute are defined.
Then the schema is closed.
The XSD is validated using the XML+XSD Validator.
