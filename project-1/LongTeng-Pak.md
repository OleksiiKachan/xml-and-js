-   I am responsible for the xml and html
-   For xml, the conversion from JSON to XML is standard. I noticed that there are `<name>` under both branch and stock so I changed the `<name>` under stock to `<stockName>`.
-   For html, I make it displaying the data dynamically. Although for each stock and account, there are 4 stocks and 2 accounts in total respectively. I coded a forEach function for them so that if in the future there are different numbers of stocks or accounts, the html can still display all data.
-   Also, I added some style to the html so that the display would be more readable
