I have worked on xsl and html document creation, implemented required css and styling in xsl and html

xsl - linked xml with xsl and defined the required table headers and parsed the xml data to display accordingly in the table format.
      I have looped through each details of book and parsed the data to represent in the table.
      Each book has multiple catalogs I have implemented another for each loop to parse multiple catalogs and display the table inside a table.

html - linked xml to html using xhttp verified the status of request.
       parsed to each element in the xml and linked to html tags to render it on the web page.
       Implemented css for it design.
