# Contribution

- After reading project description, we divided project into 4 parts.
- My part was, I've created XSL, XSD, HTML and DTD files. CSS and XML were done by another team member Krushal.
- When I was working on my part of files, I had to show each and every details in particular format without loosing data.
- In addition to that, during that time I noticed region in address which was only 2. So I used conditional statement to show regions.
