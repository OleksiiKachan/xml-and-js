Worked on DTD, XSD, XSLT and CSS part of html.

-- I have defined the DTD inside the xml document. We can also define the DTD in a separate file. DTD is used to define the structure, elements and attributes of the XML document.
-- I have created the XSD, known as XML Schema Definition, which is also used to define the structure and data types for the XML document
-- I have worked on creating the XSLT, Extensible stylsheet language transformation, to style the xml components
-- I have worked on CSS of the html page to make it visually appealing
