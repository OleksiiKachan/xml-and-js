2. The use of the CDATA in this document is to store sumary of the menu and descriptions of the items. Since CDATA is a section that may contain most markup characters, such as <, >, there is no need to use entity reference
4. The document has a prolog and a document body, but there is no epilog. There is no processing instructions as well. But on item number 7 I created a css as processing instructions. The identifications are in the xml file.
5. in the xml file and validated in the XML validator
