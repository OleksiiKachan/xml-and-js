1. Open `module-2/assignments/assignment.xml` in your browser. Are there any errors? Explain the error and fix it.

Answer - There are 3 errors which i found while validating the file.one of the tag <effective date> had space in between. Another tag had different casing and the last error was about different tag names. So i remove the space in btw the tag .For 2nd error i fixed it by matching the case of both tags and the last error was resolved by typing the same tag name in both open and closing tags.
