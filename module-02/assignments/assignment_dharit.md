# question 1
-on line 11, the xml tag should not contain any space , so the '<effective Date>' tag should be <effectiveDate> to make sense as it contain a date

-on line 31, the opening and closing tag should be same and it should follow camel case convention, so the closing </originalname > should be same as its opening tag that is </originalName>

-on line 51, as I said earlier the opening and closing tag should be similar, so the <name> tag should be <originalName>
