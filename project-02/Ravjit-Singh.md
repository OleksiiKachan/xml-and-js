# PROJECT 2

Working with API was quite tricky as at first i was ableto get the outpur using the map() method from the obtained json object using urls and endpoint. But when I tried the same for the breeds I was getting an unfamiliar CORS header missing error. But later found out that it was also due to the browser I was using for project. I aslo wan to specially thank my instructor "Mr. Oleksii Kachan" for quick assistance that lter helped reduce stress and workload resulting the completion of project 2.

I specially found out that it can be done using reduce() method but did prefer map() using as async-await,I felt more comfortable that way.

While styling the HTML page using CSS I specially used 'flex' display that is why the layout is in a grid but is responsive,hence change in display screen size will change the final output and I tried to keep the aesthetics similar to that of the anime or kindergarten type,which is why it is quite simple and edges seems as it is drawn by hand.

That's all from myself, "Ravjit Singh : N01542323" for the PROJECT 2.
