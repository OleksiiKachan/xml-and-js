The part which I was responsiple for was `index.html`
`html` is included several parts such as `head` and `body`
`head` element is used as a container for metadata for example:
<meta charset="UTF-8" /> is a specific character encoding for translating machine code into human-readable text and vice versa.
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" /> 
This tag allows web authors to choose what version of Internet Explorer the page can be used for rendering the page.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
The <link> tag is used to link to external style sheets to our website.
In `body` tag we define some div tags for dividing the different part of website.
for each div tage we define an attribute of class for designing in CSS.
<div class="wrapper"> this tag is used as a wrapper for heading and form 
<form class="search-form"> by form tag we can filter data that we want to be searched and fetched 
The attribute of `placeholder` is for putting a defult text in the search box
 <div class="rates-wrapper"> this element is as a wrapper for hohding the fetched data related to rates.
Finally we need a <script> tag. it points to our external javascript file through the src attribute.
